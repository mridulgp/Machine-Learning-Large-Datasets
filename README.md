Machine-Learning-Large-Datasets
===============================

This package implements text classification and graph sampling algorithms for large datasets.
It implements the following algorithms classification and sampling:

1. Distributed Naive Bayes
2. Memory efficient L2-regularized Logistic Regression using stochastic gradient descent.
3. Graph sampling using approximate personalized PageRank algorithm.
4. Distributed phrase counting and probabilistic sampling from Google n-gram corpus.

Package also contains classification/sampling algorithms implemented in the MapReduce framework for Hadoop. These include the following:

1. Distributed Naive Bayes.
2. Phrase counting and sampling.

Please refer to README files for each specific algorithm to train/test models.
